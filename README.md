Steps to follow:
1) Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ if not downloaded yet. You can check if you have Node.js installed already by opening a Command Prompt and running 'node --version'. Kindly use npm version above 8.
2) If you already have angular cli installed on your system, version check if it is above 8.0. If not, open a Command Prompt / PowerShell window and install angular cli using the command 'npm install @angular/cli'. after installing you can check the version by using 'ng --version' command.
3) download the repository from the following url: https://github.com/vberi02/CoxInsuranceGroup by using the Download Code button and selecting 'Download ZIP'.
4) Unzip the folder 'CoxInsuranceGroup-master' and place it in an accessible location. (Eg: C:\CoxInsuranceGroup-master)
5) open a Command Prompt window and change directory to 'vehicle-info' folder situated in 'C:\CoxInsuranceGroup-master\CoxInsuranceGroup_Angular\ClientApp\src\app\vehicle-info' of the folder you just unzipped.
6) run the command 'npm i @angular/core@8.2.12'. This should also install other dependencies required by the program.
7) run command 'ng --version' to check if everything was installed properly. You can verify the versions installed in the previous step with the package.json file situated in 'C:\CoxInsuranceGroup-master\CoxInsuranceGroup_Angular\ClientApp' folder.
8) run command 'ng serve --open' to start the angular server. It should open the webpage once it builds the project successfully.
